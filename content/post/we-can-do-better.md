We do not have to fight one another.

We do not have to kill each other.

We do not have to belittle each other for likes, or laughs.

We must embrace our differences; our flaws.

This is not a war, but a siege, on everything you know and love. Your loved ones
are enemy combatants in the eyes of the elite.

This is our fight, but we did not start it. We have been at war since birth, and
we will rage long into the night.

You are not alone. You are loved.

We can do better.
