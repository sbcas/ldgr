This is the second edition of what is going on in Chef OpenStack. The
goal is to give a quick overview to see our progress and what is on
the menu. Feedback is always welcome, as this is an iterative thing.<!--more-->

### Appetizers

continue tracking the latest 13 series.

### Entrees
* Queens development has commenced. Preliminary lab testing has
yielded positive results in Test Kitchen. Most changes seem to revolve
around deprecation chasing. https://review.openstack.org/550963 &

* More to come with upgrades. Stay tuned for specs and patches.

### On The Menu
*Buffalo Chicken Dip*
* 3-4 raw chicken breasts (flash-frozen gives a slightly different
mouth feel. it still makes food, so, you do you, boo)
* 8 ounces (226g) cream cheese / Neufchatel
* 1 cup (128g) hot sauce (Frank's RedHot recommended. substitute for
your own preferred pepper sauce)
* 1 ounce (28g) dry ranch seasoning (substitute for store-bought
powder, or salad dressing from a bottle, if you must - ranch or bleu
cheese works here)
* 4 ounces (113g) butter (grass-fed recommended because delicious)
Optional:
* 4 slices cooked and crumbled (streaky) bacon
* Cheese (shredded or cubed for melting consistency)

1. Add the chicken to a slowcooker in a single layer, if you have room.
1. Add hot sauce, butter, ranch right on top of the chicken.

   to obliterate the chicken, unless you like tangy, cheesy chicken
   mash.
