This is the first edition of what is going on in Chef OpenStack. The
goal is to give a quick overview to see our progress and what is on
the menu.<!--more-->

### Appetizers
* Focus is on branching stable/pike and releasing Pike to Supermarket
before the end of February if possible.
* Tempest will continue to focus on deploying from git instead of
packages. This provides a more consistent outcome.
* Designate cookbook works with Pike and Queens in Ubuntu. CentOS is WIP.
* A deploy guide on using Chef OpenStack in various scenarios is
being formulated. Any help here is welcome, even a rubber duck.

### Entrees
* Chef 13 has landed in master (encompassing a staggering 2+ years of
deprecations)  https://review.openstack.org/#/q/topic:bp/modern-chef
* Test Kitchen is in openstack-chef, with allinone, basic
multinode and container-based scenarios.
* https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-chef/
* MariaDB is being sourced from mariadb.org for consistency in outcome.

### Desserts
* Rakefiles are going away in favor of delivery local in Queens.
* https://docs.chef.io/delivery_cli.html
* Test Kitchen will become the focal point of CI, once we get the
right power adapter for Ansible.
* Upgrades! Upgr... you get the idea. :-)

### What's Cooking?
